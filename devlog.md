## Bugs

Clear button reverses tabtuning order

## Fix

* (Count measures), partly done but it can't remember how many measures different measures have in different sections and wrong input is possible, if measure is missing less notelength value than given it should add smaller value instead and end the measure
* Capo should be fixed

- Hold shift + arrows to select tab notes easier.
  - alternatetively make mouse able to drag instead of just click to select
- Export button to export as a txt-file
- Colorblind mode
- Missing bass and ukulele tunings
- Play button should work

## NON-NECESSARY BUT NECESSARY FIXES

* Record guitar sounds
* Add functionality to add new tunings
* In appearance settings, let the user select colors
* Make own SVG icons
* Add more settings and fix current ones

## DEFINETELY NOT NECCESSARY BUT WOULD BE COOL

* Piano icon to see the notes currently selected on a piano display
* Cookies for saving tuning and possibly tab notes incase of sudden refresh
* Sync tab to song somehow
  export to image/pdf? O _ o
* Ability to add metadata which will be pasted too
  * Capo
  * Repeat symbols
  * Song parts ([Chorus], [Verse], etc.)

## ANIMATIONS:

* Copy button should have animation for confirming it was clicked

## Fixed

* Started working on how printing the site looks
* Fixed bug where notelength shortcut would activate wrongly
* Wave animation fixed and changed to activate on tuning change
* Added more setting content
