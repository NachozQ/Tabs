<h1>Guitar Tab Maker</h1>

Intended to make creating guitar tabs easier and faster, as well as let the user listen to the tab while creating it. Syncing with actual audio would be ideal, but can be challenging because of songs often switching tempos

<strong>My wishes for this project:</strong>
- [x] Let the user change tuning, notelength, technique and toggle chord-mode
- [x] Have an interactable fretboard
- [x] Notes of pressed fretboard will be written in guitar tab, notelength will be under tab and should make sound
- [ ] Playback should be possible
- [x] Notes on tab should be editable and multi-line editing too
- [ ] Tab notes when selected should be able to toggle techniques
- [ ] Tab notes should be able to be copied, cut pasted
- [x] New lines of tab should be created with Enter
- [ ] BPM and Capo should be implemented
- [x] Setting for theme
- [x] Setting for sound on/off
- [x] Setting for seeing notename
- [x] Should be a button to copy entire tab
- [ ] Tabs from clipboard or from txt file should be able to be imported as long as they meet requirements
